# Short Bio

I'm Chris, a junior at the University of Washington double majoring in Computer Science and Economics. I have broad interests spanning quantum computing, macroeconomics, and public policy. In my current research, I'm studying how quantum algorithms could be co-designed with novel architectures and have previously worked on quantum Hamiltonian simulation. In my free time, I serve as Co-Chair of the CSE Student Advisory Council and a Board Member on the LGBTQ+@CSE group.

<!-- ## Interests
### Computer Science & Math
My research interests lie in quantum computing. Prior work includes explorations into Hamiltonian simulation via Trotterization.

### Economics
I'm particularly interested in macroeconomics and monetary policy. I'll be taking Advanced Macroeconomics (ECON 401) this fall.

### Social Good & Organizational Leadership
I am also interested in impact-oriented work, especially in empowering organizations to better serve their stakeholders.  -->


# Extracurricular
## Leadership
I currently serve as Chair of the [Student Advisory Council](https://sac.cs.washington.edu). I am lucky to serve with 15 other talented individuals. During my tenure, SAC has transformed to focus on faculty and staff relationships for actionable change.
