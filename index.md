# Short Bio

I'm Chris, a second-year CS PhD student at the University of Chicago advised by Fred Chong. My research interests are best described as *quantum architectures for Hamiltonian simulation*. I aim to design algorithms and platforms which can run transformational simulations in materials science and chemistry.

I attained a BS at the University of Washington in Computer Science and Economics, where I was advised by [Paul Beame](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~beame/beame.html) (UW), [Karol Kowalski](https://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=8494) (PNNL), Sriram Krishnamoorthy (PNNL), and Nathan Wiebe (UToronto). 


<!-- ## Current Projects (Research & Otherwise) -->
<!-- * **Memory-efficient phase estimation-based Hamiltonian simulation techniques** -->
<!-- * **Co-designed control algorithms for hybrid boson-qubit quantum computers** -->

<!-- # Academic -->

<!-- * **[A Brief Introduction to Quantum Algorithms](\assets\papers\Kang_2020Sp_Math336_QuantumReview.pdf)** (Honors Real + Complex Analysis); explored quantum search and factoring (Grover's and Shor's, respectively), and demonstrated core theorems and lemmas. -->
<!-- * **[Improving Financial Inclusion in Ghana](\assets\papers\Kang_2020Sp_Honors232_FIGhana.pdf)** (Social Entrepreneurship); research into existing strategies for financial inclusion in Ghana alongside strategies for public/private sectors players. -->


<!-- ## Interests
### Computer Science & Math
My research interests lie in quantum computing. Prior work includes explorations into Hamiltonian simulation via Trotterization.

### Economics
I'm particularly interested in macroeconomics and monetary policy. I'll be taking Advanced Macroeconomics (ECON 401) this fall.

### Social Good & Organizational Leadership
I am also interested in impact-oriented work, especially in empowering organizations to better serve their stakeholders.  -->
