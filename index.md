# Short Bio

I'm Chris, a senior at the University of Washington double majoring in Computer Science and Economics. My research interests are best described as *full stack quantum computation*, including co-designing quantum algorithms with NISQ hardware and general theory research into quantum algorithms. 

Beyond my research, I enjoy learning about science and tech policy, thinking philosophically, playing acoustic guitar and violin, and meeting new people.

I am grateful and excited to join the University of Chicago as a first-year CS PhD student in Fall 2022.


# Current Projects (Research & Otherwise)
* **Memory-efficient phase estimation-based Hamiltonian simulation techniques**
* **Co-designed control algorithms for hybrid boson-qubit quantum computers**
* **General USTPC tech policy recommendations**
* **Improving access to ugrad research within UW CSE**


# Academic

<!-- ## Interests
### Computer Science & Math
My research interests lie in quantum computing. Prior work includes explorations into Hamiltonian simulation via Trotterization.

### Economics
I'm particularly interested in macroeconomics and monetary policy. I'll be taking Advanced Macroeconomics (ECON 401) this fall.

### Social Good & Organizational Leadership
I am also interested in impact-oriented work, especially in empowering organizations to better serve their stakeholders.  -->


# Extracurricular
## Service
I am on special appointment at UW CSE to improve the undergraduate research experience. If you have comments, questions, or concerns, you're welcome to reach out to me!

## Leadership
I served as Chair/Co-Chair of the [Student Advisory Council](https://sac.cs.washington.edu). During my tenure, SAC has transformed to focus on faculty and staff relationships for actionable change. My main regret was that I wasn't able to do more due to personal limitations; I hope to continue honing my leadership skills for the next opportunity.

## Involvement
* ACM US Tech Policy Council (2021-)
* UW CSE Diversity Committee (2019-)
* Dawgbytes - K12 Outreach @ UW CSE (2019-2020)
* SAC (2018-)
* Q++ - LGBTQ @ UW CSE (2018-)

## Awards
I have been graciously supported by the Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science departments / schools:
* Hellmut Golde Endowed Scholarship, UW CSE (2021)
* George and Pearl Corkery Scholarship in Economics (2021)
* Top Honors Calculus Student (2019)
