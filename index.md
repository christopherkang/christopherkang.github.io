## Notable Papers
Below are some notable papers I've prepared.

* **[Strength Through Science: Optimizing the DOE National Laboratories](\assets\papers\Kang_2020Wi_PUBPOL_FinalPaper.pdf)** (Intro to Public Policy); a study investigating how Department of Energy National labs are operated and recommendations to improve their effectiveness.
* **[Randomized Hamiltonian Compilation](\assets\papers\Kang_2020Sp_CSE_RandomizedHamiltonian.pdf)** (Graduate Quantum Computing); demonstrating core equations in [Earl Campbell's random Hamiltonian Compilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08017) for quantum simulation.
* **[A Brief Introduction to Quantum Algorithms](\assets\papers\Kang_2020Sp_Math336_QuantumReview.pdf)** (Honors Real + Complex Analysis); explored quantum search and factoring (Grover's and Shor's, respectively), and demonstrated core theorems and lemmas.
* **[Improving Financial Inclusion in Ghana](\assets\papers\Kang_2020Sp_Honors232_FIGhana.pdf)** (Social Entrepreneurship); research into existing strategies for financial inclusion in Ghana alongside strategies for public/private sectors players.


## Interests
### Computer Science & Math
My research interests lie in quantum computing. Prior work includes explorations into Hamiltonian simulation via Trotterization 

### Economics
I'm particularly interested in macroeconomics and monetary policy. I'll be taking Advanced Macroeconomics (ECON 401) this fall.

### Social Good & Organizational Leadership



# Extracurricular
## Leadership
I currently serve as Chair of the [Student Advisory Council](sac.cs.washington.edu). I am lucky to serve with 15 other talented individuals. During my tenure, SAC has transformed to focus on faculty and staff relationships for actionable change.
