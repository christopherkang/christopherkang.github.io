# Short Bio

I'm Chris, a senior at the University of Washington double majoring in Computer Science and Economics. My research interests are focused in two areas: co-designing quantum algorithms with hardware and general theory research into quantum algorithms. Beyond my research, I am interested in the macroeconomics of inequality and tech policy. 

<!-- In my current research, I'm studying how quantum algorithms could be co-designed with novel architectures and have previously worked on quantum Hamiltonian simulation. In my free time, I serve as Co-Chair of the CSE Student Advisory Council and a Board Member on the LGBTQ+@CSE group. -->


# Current Projects (Research & Otherwise)
* **Memory-efficient phase estimation-based Hamiltonian simulation techniques**
* **Co-designed control algorithms for hybrid boson-qubit quantum computers**
* **General USTPC tech policy recommendations**


# Academic
## Notable Papers

* **[A Brief Introduction to Quantum Algorithms](\assets\papers\Kang_2020Sp_Math336_QuantumReview.pdf)** (Honors Real + Complex Analysis); explored quantum search and factoring (Grover's and Shor's, respectively), and demonstrated core theorems and lemmas.
* **[Improving Financial Inclusion in Ghana](\assets\papers\Kang_2020Sp_Honors232_FIGhana.pdf)** (Social Entrepreneurship); research into existing strategies for financial inclusion in Ghana alongside strategies for public/private sectors players.


<!-- ## Interests
### Computer Science & Math
My research interests lie in quantum computing. Prior work includes explorations into Hamiltonian simulation via Trotterization.

### Economics
I'm particularly interested in macroeconomics and monetary policy. I'll be taking Advanced Macroeconomics (ECON 401) this fall.

### Social Good & Organizational Leadership
I am also interested in impact-oriented work, especially in empowering organizations to better serve their stakeholders.  -->


# Extracurricular
## Leadership
I served as Chair/Co-Chair of the [Student Advisory Council](https://sac.cs.washington.edu). During my tenure, SAC has transformed to focus on faculty and staff relationships for actionable change. My main regret was that I wasn't able to do more due to personal limitations; I hope to continue honing my leadership skills for the next opportunity.
