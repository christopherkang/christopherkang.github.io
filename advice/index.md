## Asking for input
I'm flattered that you want my input on something! I want you to get the most out of our conversation, so I have a few ground rules to help guide the discussion.

1. Please come prepared with a meeting agenda, in particular a list of questions you want answered. **Send me this list of questions in advance so that I can also prepare + connect you with helpful people**.
2. **Take notes during our meeting** -- how many times have you walked out of class thinking, "What did I just learn?" This can be avoided by taking notes (on paper! or a device!) and then...
3. **Send me a summary of our meeting by EOD.** This (ideally) is your list of questions with my list of key insights. I will then post this summary on my website, alongside any links that might be useful to you.
4. **Pay it forward**. Friends, good advice, and allies can be hard to come by. Support is a lot like the lottery -- sometimes, it can make an astronomical difference.
5. (Optional) **Tell me where I can do better!** I'm giving advice / meeting with you because I want to help. Tell me how I can do better.
