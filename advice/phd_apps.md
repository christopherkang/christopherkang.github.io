## Before Applying
A good question to ask yourself is, “Who is going to be my adviser in my destination school?” This question can help ground your application and guide the steps you are taking to boost your application. Asking your current research advisors to help guide this search (w/ the question: who do you think would be a good advisor fit?) can be useful. 

A graduate school application consists of three main elements:
1. Curriculum Vitae (CV)
2. Statement of Purpose (SoP)
3. Letters of Recommendation

Your letters of rec are the most important, but you will spend the most time on preparing the SoP.

## CV
This is probably the most straightforward part of the application. That said, your CV must be pristine. It has to look professional and be completely free of typos.

## Statement of Purpose
This is where most of the effort for the application goes. You need to have a few reviewers. To generalize, they fall into the following categories:
1. People who understand your research terminology very well.
2. People who belong to the same branch of studies but can only understand broadly what you are talking about when you talk about your work.

You should show your statement to people from each group before taking a pass over it.

Nelson Liu’s [PhD Statement of Purpose](https://blog.nelsonliu.me/2020/11/11/phd-personal-statement/) is a great template, and Chris recommends it. In particular, Nelson addresses the question, “Why do you want to apply to this school?”

Chris' SoP is also available [here](./kang_sop_dec_2021.pdf).

## Letters of Recommendation
Typically, a PhD application calls for three letters of recommendation:
- Two of them should be research related, ideally with well-known faculty in your field
- A third research letter is nice, but schools will understand if it's a classroom recommendation instead
- You should give your recommenders **lots** of heads up (think >1 month minimum), alongside your CV and draft SoP. Ask: would you be willing to write a strong letter of rec for my PhD application? Lukewarm letters are counterproductive. 


## Secret Hints
- Have a spreadsheet of deadlines and email your letter-writers to remind them about those deadlines.
- Identify solid advisers you can go to who can read your statement ahead of time.
