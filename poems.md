# Poems

## Caelica 83
You that seek what life is in death,  
Now find it air that once was breath.  
New names unknown, old names gone:  
Till time end bodies, but souls none.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reader! then make time, while you be,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But steps to your eternity.

Baron Brooke Fulke Greville
