# Books you should read
I maintain a working list of books that I personally believe others should read. This list is intentionally kept abbreviated; I enjoy most books I finish.

This list is presented in no particular order. Forewarning: even my mom has stopped taking recommendations because my books typically involve death, grief, loss, or suffering.

### *The Friend*, Sigrid Nunez
The first time I read this book, I was unimpressed. The writing is a stream of consciousness and the plot is devoid of major events beyond adopting the dog. But, rereading this book has helped me study the nuanced, often conflicting dialogues that occur within our own minds. Nunez contextualizes the grief of a mourning friend, the depression that weighs on human and canine alike, and a society which seems to exist at extremes for sympathy: either totally absent or totally present. 

### *Imagine Me Gone*, Adam Haslett
Haslett describes the fundamental ways depression changes people and their families with incredible detail and insight. The book includes one of my favorite quotes:

> But holding Michael had always been like holding a little person, who knew that his feeding would end, who knew that if you were picked up you would be put down, that the comfort came but also went. Without knowing what it was, I'd felt that tension in his little groping arms and fitful legs, the discomfort of the foreknowledge.

This novel should be treated as an ethnographic study of a family in crisis, shattered by the suicide of a depressed father and struggling to endure decades later.

### *A Little Life*, Hanya Yanagihara
Yanagihara hyperbolizes the intrinisic, inevitable suffering each of us will be burdened by. In her book, she asks a simple question: how do we live a good life in the face of so much trauma, suffering, pain, cruelty? And her answer is simple: we live for one another, for friendship, love, wholehearted acceptance, and family. 

### *Call Me By Your Name*, Andr√© Aciman
Truly incomparable prose. This book is 200 pages of poetry detailing lust, admiration, acceptance, and love. My only warning: do not read the sequel.
