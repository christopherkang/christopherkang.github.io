# Reading
My reading habits are sinusoidal, but I'm working at making them more regular.

I enjoy books that help me think in new perspectives. I have a particular affinity for books that are emotionally devastating.

I don't think I have a favorite book. I regularly read the NYT, WSJ, Brookings, AER, AER: Insights, and TED Ideas.
