# Reading
My reading habits are sinusoidal, but I'm working at making them more regular.

I enjoy books that help me think in new perspectives. I have a particular affinity for books that are emotionally devastating.

I don't think I have a favorite book. I regularly read the NYT, WSJ, Brookings, AER, AER: Insights, and TED Ideas. I also enjoy Psyche and Aeon.

No one showers love on grown-ups. But I think we need *more* love as we get older, not less... One day, when I was lying here, I realized how old God is... He must need so much love...
