**PCC cheese diary from a lactose intolerant taster**\
I know this was unasked for, but I feel the need to share the advice after talking to my cheesemonger on a weekly basis and trying like five types of cheese through free samples alone.

-   **Biggest tip: You can ask to sample cheese at PCC**; some give bite sized pieces, Fremont PCC gives $3 chunks nicely prepackaged. Just talk to the cheesemonger
-   **Three nice, affordable cheeses to eat straight **(<$5 for good portions):

-   *Montchevre Lemon Blueberry Goat Cheese* -- came in recently, and is actually incredible. The goat cheese is lemony and creamy, and the outside is crusted with dried blueberries. Sweet, sour, and creamy.
-   *Il Forteto Pecorino Toscano Fresco* -- I think I exclaimed out loud the first time I tried this. It has a simple, creamy flavor that is deeply enjoyable. No crackers necessary.
-   *New Zealand Cheddar* -- this is a friendly cheddar. It's not super sharp, but still leaves a tang in your mouth. Also pretty cheap!

-   **Skip-it cheeses:**

-   *The one with pistachios* -- ok this one was just weird, idk the pistachios kinda ruined the cheese. Not a fan.
-   *Mimolette *-- this cheese was orange, so I was like imma try a sample. But it didn't taste like anything?
-   *Goat milk Colby Jack* -- this cheese is a nice colby Jack, but it's too expensive for the quantity
-   *Truffle goat cheese* -- I got this for when my parents came, and the truffles definitely are there, but this cheese might be relegated to entertaining. Too expensive and the truffles don't really "add" anything

-   **Controversial:**

-   *[Humboldt Fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_Fog)* -- I didn't like this cheese, but I could see other people loving it. The outer layer is creamy, like a brie, while the inner layers are goat cheese and harder. It also has an edible layer of ash. Idk, the fact that it's two cheeses coexisting was too much for me.

anyways, there's my cheese diary. have fun!
