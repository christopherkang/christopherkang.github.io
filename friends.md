# An open letter to my Friends
heyo, Chris here. Compiling this list mostly for myself, but for friends who see this, it's also for you. I have a relatively specific style of doing things; hope you can be flexible!

### Idiosyncracies
I feel that I must preface all of the following statements with, "*I apologize that I...*".

Note that:
- I respond to messages when I feel that I can be totally mentally present with you. I used to respond to messages much quicker due to anxiety of leaving queries unfulfilled; now, I prefer to reserve texts and messengers when I can be fully present.
- I prefer calls much more over texts. Calls >> voice memos > texts.
