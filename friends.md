# An open letter to my Friends
heyo, Chris here. Compiling this list mostly for myself, but for friends who see this, it's also for you. I have a relatively specific style of doing things; hope you can be flexible!

### Idiosyncracies
I feel that I must preface all of the following statements with, "*I apologize that I...*"; but, in reality, I'm not apologetic for these quirks and beliefs. They contribute toward my overall philosophy of living and being a good friend -- these tenets are a fluid part of who I am. 

Note that:
- I respond to messages when I feel that I can be totally mentally present with you. I used to respond to messages much quicker due to anxiety of leaving queries unfulfilled; now, I prefer to reserve texts and messengers when I can be fully present.
- I prefer calls much more over texts. Calls >> voice memos > texts.
- If you want something from me, please let me know directly. I almost certainly will oblige (with some constraints) and am always happy to help. But you need to be upfront and direct about it.
- I'm somewhat of an 'active friend' -- I enjoy indulging on the 'meat' of friendship. This means engaging on a >2x/week basis, avoiding small talk, practicing brevity, silence, vulnerability, and eloquence, studying the world through different lenses, upholding the intrinsic value of thought, generosity, and truth.
