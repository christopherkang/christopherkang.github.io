Copy-pasted from an email sent to peers, 6/28/22:

> I recalled that many of you are thinking about or are in honors. This is the handout I prepared for Michelle / Alan -- I would also add typical periodicals (*The Atlantic*, *NYT*, *WSJ*) all of which have a plethora of newsletters to subscribe to (daily economics, stock market, etc etc etc) and articles generally about economics. [WSJ is free](https://hub.washington.edu/about/in-the-hub/new-york-times/)
> 
> Some people also like [Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/), AER: Insights, [JEL](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/jel), [JEP](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/jep). The latter three are more technical, so the style of reading will be much different: skim abstracts, skim conclusions, try to understand the "key theme" of the paper. Then, if you're more interested, study the methodology and attempt to understand the prior literature.

> **Read what you care about!** I find financial economics + micro boring and totally skip those articles. Instead, I enjoy reading about [inequality](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/), [policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20161290), [infrastructure](https://www.wsj.com/articles/infrastructure-bill-2021-what-11627515002), [agglomeration](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/full-report-growth-centers_pdf_brookingsmetro-basscenter-itif.pdf), [antitrust](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html), [tech and econ](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-10-19/ian-bremmer-big-tech-global-order), and [foreign policy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2022-02-22/can-sanctions-be-smart).

> **Get excited**. You are thinking about critical, pressing issues of modern times. Read voraciously; talk about these articles with other people, both peers and professors. There are so many ideas out there, just waiting to be thought of.
> 
> **Reading papers**: For those who are especially interested in technical econ papers, I've stolen my approach from Brian Greaney. He studies papers from three lenses: *theory*, *empirics*, and *applicability*:
> 
> 1\. *Theory* -- what is the model used? What assumptions does it require? Where is it valid? Where does it seem shaky?
> 
> 2\. *Empirics* -- how is the model validated empirically? Where are the data's strengths? What are the limitations of the data? If there are experimented, what are the strengths/weaknesses?
> 
> 3\. *Applicability* -- what does this model, and data / experiments, tell us more broadly? How does it affirm / contradict prior literature? Can the model be extended to other settings?
> 
> (final unsolicited tip: **print articles and put them in places where you have no other choice but to read**. e.g. toilet -- adults read >= 200 wpm. say you spend 10 min total in the bathroom / day. 200 * 10 * 30 ~ 60,000 words per month -> **120 pages / month**)
