- One of the most important things is to reach out and talk to people, grad students, professors, other undergrads. Going to theory lunch is a great way to do that (and one of its purposes -- so take advantage of it). 
- Mathematical maturity is important, one way to improve it is to take math 33x 
- In most graduate CS areas, having three letters of rec worth of research is important for PhD applications. In theory research, because of the higher bar of entry to research, it’s okay to have more coursework based / reading based letters of rec.
- It’s also important to take a wider variety of courses. It’s tempting to only try to take math or cs courses, but you’re missing out on opportunities to become a more balanced person. Most importantly, find gen. eds that are interesting to you. Don’t choose them just because they’re easy. (my personal viewpoint but some disagree (e.g. erdos), albeit some agree (e.g. poincare))
- Undergrad CS courses can have stressful curves. Go over a past version of the graduate version of the course and see if it’s something you can handle. If you need to fill any gaps and can self-learn them, do that. 
- You will be sacrificing $$$ by pursuing a PhD 
- Don’t be afraid to reach out to professors, even if you don’t feel ready for research. You can phrase the conversation as, "what path will get me to research?". You can also ask about reading papers or texts together. Responding to and guiding students about things like this is part of their job, don’t feel like you are imposing.
- Look for and ask about REUs (math or cs). They are research opportunities explicitly made for undergrads, so they can be a straightforward way to get research experience. (I don't know much more about these yet)

Thanks to Robert Stevens for typing this up from our conversation.
