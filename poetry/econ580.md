W2: 
What do we know? 
When I was young, I thought there were facts true,
But now, everything seems relative, to only hold value
upon a bed of axioms, laid by forerunners.
A foundation, unshakeable but assumed.
Bonferroni, Boole, they produce their lemmas,
Bounding unions and intersections,
Yet, they don't address my key dilemma:

What is random - a single universe from many, or something more subtle?
