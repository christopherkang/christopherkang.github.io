I have not been feeling well. So, I'm cataloguing some poems I've written while feeilng this way.

After having a nice day with Millicent at Uwajimaya.

They walk home together,
A pair, with wide eyes brown,
A girl, a fish, a dish.

He dreams of flavor, sauce,
and yearns for leafy friends.
But his hopes are chilled.

Yet, a tenderness comes,
It emerges from her
kindness, dilligence, sweat. 

His companions are not
Leafy, rather caustic.
They still embrace with love.

Will time heal all his wounds?
Not alone, not in cold.
A spirit can be repaired.

Reborn, he is complete.
Restored, she feels completed.

An incandescent fall to behold,  
So sheer, so bright!  
With wilting wicks of yellow and gold.

And yet, I stare: they remain unsold.  
Their patience is burnt and they take flight.  
Hissing: this procession lacks food!

Why are they blind in sight?  
Though my view is buried in blue,  
Rain is perspective - and I can't take flight.
