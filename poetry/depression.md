I have not been feeling well. So, I'm cataloguing some poems I've written while feeilng this way.

An incandescent fall to behold,  
So sheer, so bright!  
With wilting wicks of yellow and gold.

And yet, I stare: they remain unsold.  
Their patience is burnt and they take flight.  
Hissing: this procession lacks food!

Why are they blind in sight?  
Though my view is buried in blue,  
Rain is perspective - and I can't take flight.
